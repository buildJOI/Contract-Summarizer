A powerful Python tool to automatically summarize legal contracts, extracting key points and reducing lengthy documents into concise, readable summaries.

## Overview

Reading through dense legal contracts is a time-consuming and often confusing task. This **Contract Summarizer** leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse complex legal documents (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`) and generate a short, coherent summary. It's designed to help lawyers, paralegals, and business professionals quickly grasp the essential terms and clauses of a contract without needing to read it cover to cover.

This tool uses an **extractive summarization** approach, identifying and pulling out the most important sentences from the source text to form a summary.

## Key Features

-   **Multi-Format Support:** Process contracts in various formats, including `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt`.
-   **Extractive Summarization:** Intelligently identifies and extracts the most critical sentences to create a factual summary.
-   **Key Term Identification:** Automatically pulls out important keywords and phrases (e.g., "Governing Law," "Termination Clause," "Confidentiality").
-   **Customizable Summary Length:** Easily adjust the length of the summary (e.g., 20% of the original text).
-   **Purely Command-Line:** A lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use tool that runs directly in your terminal.

## Demo

Here is an example of how the script processes a document and outputs a summary.

**Input:** `legal_contract.pdf` (10 pages, 2500 words)
**Output:** `summary_legal_contract.txt` (1 page, 500 words)

```bash
# Example of running the script
$ python summarize.py contracts/long_nda.pdf --length 20

Processing 'contracts/long_nda.pdf'...
Original word count: 2500
Summary word count: 498

Summary saved to: summaries/summary_long_nda.txt
